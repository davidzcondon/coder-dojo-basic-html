## Github

### Repository
A repository is a place where you can store code or documents relating to a project, website etc. You can create a new repository from [this page](https://github.com/davidzcondon?tab=repositories) by clicking the new button. Github will then ask for the name of the repository and a description. Enter these, select to create a README and then click create.

You can use repositories as a place to store the code to build a website. Github will serve out repositories as webpages under your main github address. For example a repository called website could be accessed at https://davidzcondon.github.io/website.

### Readme
This is a document which contains a description of what the repository is. It can also contain instructions to build the project etc.

### Pages
To serve out the repository as a website, go to the settings->pages tab. Select source to be the master branch. This will serve out the repository as a html website. To create a Jekyll website follow [these instructions](https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/)
