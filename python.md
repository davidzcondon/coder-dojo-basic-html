# Python

* Launch the IDLE program to run your python
* You can enter single commands directly at the prompt.
* Python files end in `.py`. You can write Python programs in these files. These can have multiple commands on after the other.

## Numbers
* A normal number is called an integer in programming. This is sometimes called int for short.
* Arithmetic is another work for maths and Python supports a number of arithemetic operations e.g. + is plus, - is minus, * is multiply and / is divide.
* You can type arithmetic expressions directly at the command prompt and it will give you the result

## Strings
* A string is a sequence of characters. These can be words or sentences. If you are typing it in to the program file you should surround it by quotes e.g. `"hello"` or `"noob"` or `"."` or `"7"`.
* You can join strings together using `+` e.g. `"hello" + " " + " noob"`
* To convert something to a string you use `str()` e.g. to convert `10` to `"10"` you use `str(10)`

## Print
* To print you use `print()` and the thing you want to print goes in between the brackets.
* You can print strings directly by typing them in with quotes e.g. `print("hello world")`
* You can print out a number by putting it in between the brackets. If you are printing a single number it doesn't matter if you use quotes or not.
	* If you print a number expression with quotes then it will print whatever is on the screen exactly. `print("7+3")` will print out `7+3`.
 	* If you don't have the quotes it will do whatever arithmetic operation first and only print out the result. `print(7+3)` will print out `10`
* To join things together and print them you can use `+` but both sides of the plus must be a string.

## Variables

* A variable is a place to store a piece of information. This can store an integer or a string or any other expression.
* A variable has a name which can be used later to refer to the variable
* A variable has a type which tells us what is stored in the variable e.g. integer, string
* A variable has a value which is the thing stored in the variable. The value can be changed to another value later.
* We use the `=`sign to store something in a variable e.g. `davids_age = 7`
